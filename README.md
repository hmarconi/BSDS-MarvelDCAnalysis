# BSDS-MarvelDCAnalysis

This repository includes the following three files:

marvdc.csv : This file contains data collected from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/marvel-vs-dc?select=db.csv). The data in this file contains information about films released from 2004-2019 by both Marvel and DC. I used this data to make analyses and draw conclusion about how Marvel and DC films have performed, and subsequently, which company may produce "better" films. 

Final_ProjBSDS100.Rmd : This R Markdown file contains all of the analysis I performed on the data including filter, visualizing, and linear regression.
